src/autocontext.py
```
The file contains functions for identifying necessary project files and summarizing their contents. The `context_files` function requires the project file structure and user instructions to return the relative file paths of the files that the developer needs to see. The `summarize_files` function takes a list of files and returns a dictionary of their file paths and their summaries, generated by a thorough but concise summarizer. The `main` function takes the current project directory and user instructions as arguments, gets the file structure, calls `context_files` to identify the necessary files, and then prints the identified files. The main function is not currently being called, and the file is being used to run `summarize_files` on two sample files, "src/prompt.py" and "commands/prompt".
```

src/summarize.py
```
This file contains a Python program to summarize the contents of files in a given directory using OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The program loops through each file in the directory, reads its contents, and summarizes them using a chat prompt with the GPT-3 model. The resulting summaries are saved in a dictionary with file paths as keys, and the dictionary is serialized to a file using FileDataBundle. The program can be run with two command-line arguments: the directory to summarize and the name of the output file (default is "summaries.md").
```

src/cli.py
```
This Python file takes a natural language text as input and translates it into a terminal command. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate the terminal command based on the input text. The resulting command is processed and printed to the console, and is also copied to the clipboard using the pyperclip library. The input text is expected to be passed as an argument from the command line, and the usage format is "python cmd.py <input_string>".
```

src/prompt.py
```
This file contains a Python script that generates a string representing the file structure and contents of a specified directory. This is accomplished through the `prompt_gen` function, which takes a directory path and an optional "ignore" argument and returns the generated string. The `main` function calls `prompt_gen` with user-specified source and target file paths, and then writes the resulting string to the target file. Finally, the function calculates the length of the encoded string using the `tiktoken` module and displays it. The script takes two command-line arguments: the source directory and the target file.
```

src/lib/openai_lib.py
```
This Python file contains two functions: `get_api_key()` and `chat_prompt()`. 

`get_api_key()` is a function that retrieves and returns the OpenAI API key from a file or an environment variable. If the file `OPENAI_API_KEY.txt` is located in the `~/scripts` directory, it will read and return its content. If not, it will check if an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists and return its content. If neither option is available, it will raise an exception `ApiKeyError` with a message asking the user to provide an API key either in the file or the environment variable.

`chat_prompt()` is a function that takes in a system message and user message(s) and returns a response message from OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The user message(s) could either be a string or a list of strings. The function first converts the user messages to a list of dictionaries containing the role, which is the user here, and the message content. It then sends a request to OpenAI's API to complete the conversation using the specified model, system and user messages. Finally, it returns the generated response message from the model.
```

src/lib/util.py
```
This file contains two functions: 

1. `find_files` returns a list of all files under a given directory and its subdirectories, with an option to include or exclude the relative path of the files, and an option to exclude the '__pycache__' directory.
 
2. `tree_str` runs the 'tree' command on a specified directory and returns the output as a string, with any ANSI escape sequences removed from the output.
```

src/lib/file_data_bundle.py
```
This file contains a `FileDataBundle` class that inherits from a dictionary and provides methods for loading, bundling and saving file data. The `load` method loads file data from a file, the `bundle_directory` method bundles file data from a directory, and the `save` method saves the file data to an output file. There is also a `__str__` method that formats the file data bundle as a string.
```
